/*in order to read HTTP POST data , we have to use "body-parser" node module. body-parser is a piece of express middleware that reads a form's input and stores it as a javascript object accessible through req.body â€“ refactor
With express you can read any data inside HTTP request, such as headers req.headers (array), you can read the body of the http packet as req.body explained by @CleanCrispCode and you can read as query parameter req.query.variable, 
It helps since express automatically transforms the request in javascript objects this might be one of the many reasons we have to use body parser, but it doesn't say what it does, i.e. that HTTP request and response objects are
 streams and that they're not 'readable' as single object like res.body without the entire stream being buffered into res.body first. */
